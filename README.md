# Write_ups

## Description

In this repository, I will be sharing detailed write-ups of various labs that I have successfully pwned. These write-ups include step-by-step walkthroughs of the techniques and tools used to exploit the vulnerabilities in each lab environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To follow along with the write-ups, you will need:

- A basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts
- Familiarity with penetration testing tools such as Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite

### Usage

Each directory in this repository contains:

- **Lab Description**: An overview of the lab environment and objectives.
- **Steps to Exploit**: Detailed steps and commands used to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- **Screenshots**: Visual aids to help understand each step.
- **Additional Notes**: Any additional information or insights gained during the exploitation process.
